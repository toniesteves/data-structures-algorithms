# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and solutions to various **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** commonly used in computer science. The focus is on understanding fundamental concepts, providing efficient implementations, and solving problems related to these topics.

## 📌 Overview

This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** by implementing them in Python (or other languages). Each section includes explanations, example use cases, and time complexity analysis of the solutions.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
- Fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.
- Implementations of various operations such as searching, insertion, and deletion.

### Linked Lists
- A collection of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.
- Includes implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.

### Stacks
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.
- Used in algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and balancing parentheses.

### Queues
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure.
- Includes implementations of basic queue, priority queue, and deque.

### Trees
- Hierarchical data structure with nodes.
- Includes Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and more.

### Graphs
- A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges.
- Includes various types of graphs (directed, undirected, weighted, etc.) and implementations of common graph algorithms.

### Hash Tables
- A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookups.
- Implementation of hash functions and handling collisions.
